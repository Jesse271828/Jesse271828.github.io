<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a fourth year undergraduate currently applying to phd programs. I started out as a physics major, and I have backgrounds in math probability, stochastic processes, statistics, ML/RL, information theory, and operations research. For more than a year I’ve been advised by professor <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Kannan Ramchandran</a>.</p> <p>I included many <a href="https://jesse271828.github.io/projects/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">projects</a> in different areas that I’ve completed in my undergraduate years. They usually begin with a couple quick paragraphs of the incentives behind them, and conclude with the presentables.</p> <p>In <a href="https://jesse271828.github.io/coursework/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">coursework</a>, I describe the courses at Berkeley that had significant impact on me along with the teachers and textbooks who are responsible for them.</p> </body></html>
