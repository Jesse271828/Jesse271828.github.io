<h1 style="font-size:7">Bio</h1>

I am a fourth year undergraduate currently applying to phd programs. For more than a year I've been advised by professor <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/'> Kannan Ramchandran</a>. I also work with professor <a href='https://yanchiwei.github.io/'> Chiwei Yan</a>. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, statistics, and operations research.

I included many <a href='https://jesse271828.github.io/projects/'>projects</a> in different areas that I've completed in my undergraduate years. They usually begin with a couple quick paragraphs of the incentives behind them, and conclude with the presentables.

In <a href='https://jesse271828.github.io/coursework/'>coursework</a>, I describe the courses at Berkeley that had significant impact on me along with the teachers and textbooks who are responsible for them.
