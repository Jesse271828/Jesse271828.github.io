<h1 style="font-size:7">Bio</h1>

I am a fourth year undergraduate currently applying to PhD programs. For more than a year, I was more than fortunate to be advised by professor <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/'> Kannan Ramchandran</a>. I am also honored by working with professor <a href='https://yanchiwei.github.io/'> Chiwei Yan</a>. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, information theory, statistics, and operations research. 

I included many <a href='https://wjingxing.github.io/projects/'>projects</a> in different areas that I've completed in my undergraduate years. They usually begin with a couple quick paragraphs of the incentives behind them, and conclude with the presentables.

I'm planning on graduating with a double degree in applied mathematics and computer science. Here are my essential <a href='https://wjingxing.github.io/coursework/'> coursework</a>.
