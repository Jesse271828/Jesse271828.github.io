I am a fourth year undergraduate applying to phd programs. I started out as a physics major, and I have backgrounds in math probability, stochastic processes, statistics, ML/RL, information theory, and algebra. For more than a year I've been advised by professor <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/'> Kannan Ramchandran</a>. 

I want to dedicate this paragraph to the classes that I thought shaped by education.
