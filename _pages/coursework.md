Fall 2022 and spring 2024, I was fortunate to take the EECS 126/226 series, which covered different topics in probability and random processes. The prior was taught by my advisor <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kannanr/'>Kannan</a>, and the latter was taught by professor <a href='https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sahai.html'>Sahai</a>. The first third of 126 was a very fast-paced going through of measure-free probability. Kannan personally believed that it's more straightforward to teach probability without having to define sigma algebras and measures. We were fed with very difficult problems. The course then took a turn and quickly went through topics in stochastic processes, the most important ones of which are Markov chains and random graphs. We spent two lectures on information theory and a couple more on coding theory related topics. Then, the class concluded with estimation and testing. As a graduate version of 126, 226 kept most of its topics in alignment with 126, but there was actually barely any repetition. In the beginning we were just proving theorem in analysis and measure theory. It was actually quite exciting to see all the details in CLT and SLLN. The random processes were much more oriented toward the directions of our lab: things were introduced from a signal processing perspective. We had to deal with the statistical behaviors of different kinds of filters. Overall, these two classes were on top of my mind when I thought about which courses were to shape my education at Berkeley. Both professors were excellent in dilivering their lectures. They were mostly responsible for my decision to dedicate the majority of my portion of exploration to information and statistics related areas.
