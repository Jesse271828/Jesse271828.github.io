This is a project I did with **Mert Cemri**, who was first year PhD student at BLISS. It's a final project for a class on **deep reinforcement learning**, and we ended up completing a report of **12 pages**, receiving a **96/100** for the project. **We are currently working on comparing the novel methods we developed with baselines in the field of trading with MDPs and possibly submitting to a conference or journal.**
